Practicing setting up CI for C++ code

I'm loosely following this tutorial (http://gueepo.me/blog/simple-ci-for-cpp/). It's quite good so far, but it does lack explanations about some of his decisions such as CMake/directory setup which makes it a bit difficult to reproduce. I'm might make a Medium article to explain.
